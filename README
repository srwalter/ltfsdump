ltfsdump
========
I wrote this to help recover a tape that had gotten into a sad state.  Use the
"dump" command first:

    $ ./dump /dev/nst0

This will dump out all the indices and data extents from the data partition of
the tape to the current directory.  Then you can run ltfsdump, which will parse
a given index and reconstruct the files from data in the current directory:

    $ cargo run
